# Internship
This repository documents my internship first journey , including the tasks, learnings, and progress made each day. Each day focuses on a specific topic to enhance my skills and contribute effectively to the project.

## Day 1: Git and GitHub
The focus of Day 1 is to understand the Git and GitHub, which are essential tools for version control and collaboration. The tasks include learning about branching, staging, tagging, creating PRs/MRs, resolving conflicts, and more.

### Topics Covered
1. **Branching**
   Branches allow you to isolate your work.
```bash
  git branch                          
  git branch <branch-name>            
  git checkout <branch-name>          
  git switch <branch-name>            
  git switch -c <branch-name>         
  git branch -m <old-name> <new-name> 
  git branch -d <branch-name>         
```
2. **Staging**
  Preparing changes to be committed.
```bash
  git add <file-name>             
  git add .                       
  git status                      
  git commit -m "Commit message"  
  git commit -am "Commit message" 
```
3. **Git diff, stash, Tags**
   Diff shows the differences between two commits.
   Stash is a way to save your changes in a temporary location.
   Tags mark specific points in history, such as releases.
```bash
   git diff
   git stash
   git tag
   git tag <tag-name>
```
